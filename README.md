# Bookmarklets Website
This is the Repo that hosts the website.
If you want all of the bookmarklets, than download the htmlfile and import it into your browser.
If you want to install a single bookmarklet, than go [here](https://inyourface34456.github.io/bookmarklets-website) and drag the disired bookmarklet to your bookmark bar.

Btw, credit goes to Nakul-Ardeshana, and many orthers (if you want to be included, ask me).
